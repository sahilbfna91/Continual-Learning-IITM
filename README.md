# Continual-Learning-IITM
The above experiments were performed for my Master's Thesis at IIT-M <br />
Final_Presentation will give an brief overview of the work <br />
The complete details of these experiments and their results can be found in the file Final_Report. <br />

File Description: <br />

1. CL_Basic: Contains all the basic experiments needed to understand Continual Learning and observe Catastrophic forgetting in Neural nets.
2. CL_RMNs: Experiments performed to overcame Catastrophic forgetting by using Relevance Mapping Networks. [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11343)
3. CL_IMM:  Experiments performed to overcame Catastrophic forgetting by using Incremental Moment Matching primarily we have used Mean and Mode based IMM.[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08475)
4. CL_DLGNs: Experiments performed over DLGN Architecture [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03403) , here we try to see if changing layer wise or node wise learning rate effect help overcoming catastrophic forgetting.
5. CL_DLGN_EWC: Exxperiments performed over DLGN Architecture but this time we have used Elastic Weight Collision technique [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00796.pdf) to overcome Catastrophic Forgetting.
